message:
  initial: "Hi! In order to compensate for the efforts of processing PRs, we kindly ask for a contribution.\n
    ðŸ’€ As **there is no refund**, before **paying the fee**, make sure **new tokens fulfill the minimum circulation and other [acceptance criteria](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-submit-a-token-logo/3863)**.\n
    See also the [PR Fee FAQ](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset/pr-fee).\n\n
    Please pay  **$PAY1_AMOUNT $PAY1_SYMBOL**  with the memo **$PAY1_MEMO**  to the address `$PAY1_ADDRESS`.\n
    Alternatively, $PAY2_AMOUNT $PAY2_SYMBOL is also accepted (same memo & address).\n\n
    $QR_CODE\n\n
    *Notes*:\n\n
    * [Trust Wallet Tokens (TWT)](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/trust-wallet-token-twt/4187) can be obtained through our [Referral Program](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/invite-a-friend-earn-trust-wallet-token-twt/4125) or [from DEXs/exchanges](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/where-to-get-trust-wallet-tokens/76641).\n
    * New tokens without significant usage are rejected, see criteria mentioned above.\n
    * One PR should be for a single project; PR's with more than 10 logos will be rejected.\n
    * Payment evaluation happens automatically, but with a few minutes delay.  When payment is detected, an Accept Review is automatically placed on the PR, which is a condition for merge.\n
    * Evaluating the PR is done manually, and it is merged only if all conditions are satisfied.\n
    * TWT-BEP2 is supported (Binance Chain), TWT-BEP20 version on Smart Chain is not.\n\n
    There will be a fee to process this request. None of it goes to the developers.\n
    Before paying the fee, make sure new tokens fulfill the minimum circulation and other acceptance criteria.\n
    If you are paying TWT for the submission, this will be burned automatically. There will be no refunds."
  not_received: "Fee has not been received yet (or not fully)."
  received: "Fee is PAID, fantastic! Thanks! Review added.\n\n
    The PR will be evaluated soon by a maintainer, and if merged, the new logos should be visible in Trust Wallet.\n
    Please note that the app caches logos (up to several days; if you want to see changes immediately, use a new installation). See the [assets FAQ](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets#faq).\n
